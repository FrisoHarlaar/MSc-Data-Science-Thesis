Robbed of his emancipation by his master's widow, a literate 14-year-old slave boy flees into the prairie. His journey crosses a territory ripped apart in conflict over slavery: stolen elections, printing presses thrown in the river, church houses nailed shut. But folk stories and campfire songs help him find conductors on the Underground Railroad. Slavecatchers dog his trail, but before the runaway can cross the river to freedom, he must first place his faith in an illiterate freewoman."

        "description": "Based on a True Story:\nBorn in a remote village during her country's liberation war, a Bangladeshi girl moves to England with her parents and struggles for freedom and identity while growing up in a mixed neighborhood. Caught between the world of her white friends and that of her parents, she scraps her Muslim gear for blue jeans and runs away with her boyfriend.\nBut when her father tracks her down and finds her, he tricks her into going to Bangladesh so that he can marry her off.\nIn Bangladesh, she is faced with a choice: get married or never go home.\nIt's an unforgettable true story about heartache and irony. About broken dreams. And how the life we choose is not always the life that chooses us.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nL.A. Sherman grew up in Bradford, England where she learned how to sneak out of the house without making the door creak. At the age of fifteen, she was tricked into going to Bangladesh by her parents and forced to marry a man as old as her father. After four years there with a wicked mother-in-law, she won the visa lottery for America and moved to the Big Apple. Now hard at work on her second book, she lives in Tampa, Florida with her family near a pond full of gators and spends her time doing all the things that Bengali girls don't."

        "description": "William Silver is a talented and charismatic young teacher whose unconventional methods raise eyebrows among his colleagues and superiors. His students, however, are devoted to him. His teaching of Camus, Faulkner, Sartre, Keats, and other kindred souls breathes life into their sense of social justice and their capacities for philosophical and ethical thought. But unbeknownst to his adoring pupils, Silver proves incapable of living up to the ideals he encourages in others.\nEmotionally scarred by failures in his personal life and driven to distraction by the City of Light's overpowering carnality and beauty, Silver succumbs to a temptation that will change the course of his life. His fall will render him a criminal in the eyes of some and all too human in the eyes of others.\nIn Maksik's stylish prose, Paris is sensual, dazzling, and dangerously seductive. It serves as a fitting backdrop for a dramatic tale about the tension between desire and action, and about the complex relationship that exists between our public and private selves."

Instead of harping on past problems and behavior, the Women For Sobriety program focuses on the future, showing women how to build up their emotional strength, self-esteem, and positive approach to life essential to recovery."

One is the now legendary tale of a defiant Jew's refusal to abandon God, even in the face of the greatest suffering the world has known, a testament of faith that has taken on an unpredictable and fascinating life of its own and has often been thought to be a direct testament from the Holocaust.\nThe parallel story is that of Zvi Kolitz, the true author, whose connection to Yosl Rakoverhas been obscured over the fifty years since its original appearance. German journalist Paul Badde tells how a young man came to write this classic response to evil, and then was nearly written out of its history. With brief commentaries by French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas and Leon Wieseltier, author of Kaddish, this edition presents a religious classic and the very human story behind it."

Through deep reporting with key activists and thinkers, passionately personal writing, and distinguished cultural criticism, We Gon' Be Alright links #BlackLivesMatter to #OscarsSoWhite, Ferguson to Washington D.C., the Great Migration to resurgent nativism. Chang explores the rise and fall of the idea of \"diversity,\" the roots of student protest, changing ideas about Asian Americanness, and the impact of a century of racial separation in housing. He argues that resegregation is the unexamined condition of our time, the undoing of which is key to moving the nation forward to racial justice and cultural equity."

Billboard tycoon Oliver Mercer has been brutally slain in his home in the Pasadena hills, joined in death by his long-legged trophy girlfriend-both of their bodies displayed in a chilling tableau. The murder scene reawakens terrible memories for homicide detective Nan Vining, who survived her own harrowing attack a year earlier. While tracking the taunting gameplayer her daughter Emily dubbed T. B. Mann-The Bad Man-she is now working the Mercer case alongside her ex-flame Jim Kissick, stirring up conflicted feelings in her. From the ritzy estates of L.A.'s Lamborghini-driving set to a rocky desert outpost where rattlesnakes whisper murder, Nan will risk both her badge and her heart on a case that cuts close to the bone."

        "description": "This is a living history of the legendary journey that made Mao's China. In October 1934, the First Front Army of the Chinese Communist Party fled annihilation by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists. Some 80,000 men, women and children left their homes to walk with Mao into the unknown. One year, 4,000 miles and countless battles later, fewer than 4,000 were left. From these survivors would grow the army that conquered China 14 years on, changing history for ever. In October 2002, Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen set off to retrace the Red Army's footsteps, and record the experiences of the last-remaining witnesses and participants of the Long March - before it was too late. The result is an account of the March based squarely on eye-witness accounts. It contrasts starkly with the official version and with recent contentions that the March was a fraud. The Long March really did happen, but it was spun into the key propaganda tool Mao wielded in his rise to ultimate power. Bringing together the historic event, with images of a changing society and their own March - a remarkable feat of endurance in itself - the authors offer a unique picture of China, past and present."

        "description": "The fateful kick of Mrs. O'Leary's cow, the wild flight before the flames, the astonishingly quick rebuilding--these are the well-known stories of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. But as much as Chicago's recovery from disaster was a remarkable civic achievement, the Great Fire is also the story of a city's people divided and at odds. This is the story that Karen Sawislak tells so revealingly in this book.\nIn a detailed account, drawn on memoirs, private correspondences, and other documents, Sawislak chronicles years of widespread, sometimes bitter, social and political conflict in the fire's wake, from fights over relief soup kitchens to cries against profiteering and marches on city hall by workers burned out of their homes. She shows how through the years of rebuilding the people of Chicago struggled to define civic order--and the role that \"good citizens\" would play within it. As they rebuilt, she writes, Chicagoans confronted hard questions about charity and social welfare, work and labor relations, morality, and the limits of state power. Their debates in turn exposed the array of values and interests that different class, ethnic, and religious groups brought to these public discussions.\n\"Sawislak combines the copious detail of a historian with the vivid portrayals of a storyteller in her investigation of the infamous Chicago fire. . . . Highlighted by historical maps, plates and engravings, with an epilogue and notes, Smoldering Citypresents an extremely thorough and engaging study of this extraordinary disaster.\"--Publishers Weekly"
